---> using mount command 

mount -v -t nfs <hostname:/<path of mount in server>> </path to file on which we want to mount in local sysytem>

add -r flag if we want to mount in readonly

---> using fstab

do sudo vi /etc/fstab and add the following entry

<hostname:/<path of mount in server>> </path to file on which we want to mount in local sysytem> nfs default 0 0
 if we want real only then instead of default add ro
 example : <hostname:/<path of mount in server>> </path to file on which we want to mount in local sysytem> nfs ro 0 0
 
 then do sudo mount -a to mount all the entries in fstab
 
 ---> using autofs
 
 first create a mapping file in /etc
 example : touch /etc/auto.mapping_exapmle
 then create a directory for mounting the mount points
 example : mkdir /home/hari/test
 
 note : this directory will be owned by auto fs so we should not create anythis in this directory
 
 
 do vi /etc/autofs.master
 
 add the following entry 
 </path on local machine where u want to mount all the mounts> <the mapping file we created> 
 if we want we can add timeout
 
 example
 /home/hari/test /etc/auto.mapping_exapmle --timeout=3000
 
 now add the following entry in /etc/auto.mapping_example
 
 <folder name for mount point>  -fstype=nfs <hostname:/<path of mount in server>>
 
 do sudo service autofs reload
 
 ---> using bindfs
 
 first mount a mountpoint using anyof the above methods
 
 then do bindfs -u <username who needs to own all the files in the mount> -g <group name who needs to own all the files> <path of mount point on local system> <path to the file on which we want to mount using the new owner and group>
 ex : bindfs -u hari -g test_group /home/hari/test /home/hari/test_bindfs
 Note : before running the bindfs make sure you have the destination folder present
